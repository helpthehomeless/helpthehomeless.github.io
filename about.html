		<p>We are the Help the homeless foundation. This foundation was started by Tristan and Tatum M. Two kids that decided that helping people without a home could would be nice, so they decided to make care packages for the homeless people they saw. They would fill the packages with necessary items for example a toothbrush, toothpaste, food, waterbottles, blankets and other items needed to live through daily lives. They thought that maybe if they started a foundation where people donate, they could help spread awarness to encourage others to donate to the ones in need. They soon turned to Zachary B and asked him for his assistance on creating a website in which you can donate to help with buying the items in the care packages. Zachary B thought it was a nice and kind movement, so he decided to join and help the Help the homeless foundation. The foundation decided it would be a non-profit organization and we would have all the the money put into making the care packages. We hope to one day improve the quality of the packages. For more information on what is in the care packages, you could click onto the Info page where it will tell you all about what comes inside the packages, and what your donations will be used for.</p>
